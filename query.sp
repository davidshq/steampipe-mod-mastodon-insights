  /*
  Joining with `mastodon_relationship` is possible, and useful -- I want to see at a glance
  if a person I follow has followed me back! -- but not yet practical. The API's `accounts/relationships`
  endpoint takes an array of ids, but the `mastodon_relationship` table for now only takes one id at a time because
  you can't make an URL like `accounts/relationships?id[]=1&id[]=2...&id[]=500`. The one-at-a-time approach
  is not only slow, but worse, quickly exhausts the 300-API-calls-per-5-minutes limit if you are following
  hundreds of people.

  TBD: Work out a way to query `mastodon_relationship` with batches of (10? 100?) ids.

  Meanwhile, see query.search_people, this approach is practical there if the query yields a small result set.
